# Average of Three

It is Chef's birthday. You know that Chef's favourite number is `X`. You also know that Chef loves averages. Therefore, you decide it's best to gift Chef **3 integers** `A1`, `A2`, and `A3`, such that:

- The mean of `A1`, `A2`, and `A3` is `X`.
- `1 ≤ A1, A2, A3 ≤ 1000`.
- `A1`, `A2`, and `A3` are **distinct**.

Output any suitable `A1`, `A2`, and `A3` which you could gift to Chef.
